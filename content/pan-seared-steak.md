Pan-seared steak is a cooking method that involves cooking a steak in a hot pan with a small amount of oil. The high heat of the pan creates a nice sear on the outside of the steak, while the low cooking time ensures that the inside of the steak remains juicy and tender.

- üç≥ Cook time: 10 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 1

## Ingredients

- 1 boneless, ribeye, sirloin, or strip steak (1-inch thick)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt
- Black paper 

## Directions

1.  Pat the steak dry with paper towels.
2. Season the steak with salt and pepper on both sides.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it is very hot.
4. Add the steak to the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until it reaches the desired level of doneness.
5. Remove the steak from the skillet and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

## Tips for cooking a Steak
* Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak. The following are the recommended internal temperatures for different levels of doneness:
    * Rare: 120-125 degrees Fahrenheit
    * Medium-rare: 130-135 degrees Fahrenheit
    * Medium: 140-145 degrees Fahrenheit
    * Medium-well: 150-155 degrees Fahrenheit
    * Well-done: 160-165 degrees Fahrenheit
* Don't overcrowd the pan. If you're cooking more than one steak, cook them in batches so that they have enough room to sear evenly.
* Don't overcook the steak. A well-cooked steak should be pink in the center. If you're not sure how to cook a steak to your liking, start with a lower temperature and cook it for a shorter amount of time. You can always cook it longer if needed
